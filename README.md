## Project Topic: Customer Churn Prediction
## Description: 
Customers are a company's most valuable asset, and keeping customers is critical for any organisation looking to increase revenue and develop long-term meaningful 
relationships with customers. Furthermore, the cost of obtaining a new client is five times that of keeping an existing customer.**Customer Churn/Attrition** is one of the most well known business difficulties in which consumers or subscribers drop doing business with a service or a firm. Ideally, they will no longer be a paying customer. A client is considered to have been churned if a certain length of time has passed since the consumer last interacted with the company. Identifying whether or not a client will churn and offering relevant information aimed at customer retention are crucial to lowering churn. Our brains cannot anticipate customer turnover for millions of clients.  
### Here is where **machine learning may assist.**

### Implementation:
  * Data Preprocessing and Visualisation
  * Dimensionality Reduction and Parameter-Tuning
  * Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning models
